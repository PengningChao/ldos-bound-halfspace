# ldos-bound-halfspace
Computes finite bandwidth bounds on photonic local density of states maximization via material structuring given a semi-infite halfspace design region
Supporting code for [arXiv:2209.08668](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08668). 

## main
Main scripts for evaluating LDOS bounds for both scalar (TM) and vector (TE) electric field polarizations in 2D space. 

## test
Scripts that numerically verify correctness of important intermediate steps

## auxiliary
Text files containing long symbolic expressions and calculations that are needed for the evaluation of TE bounds.
